# The Digger
We're making a game!

Pending further input from Lily and her own documentation here, The Digger is a game wherein you explore a building you are trapped inside of while some sort of mysterious entity tries to reach you by digging its way through the ceiling (once it believes it has found you, of course)

## Branch Structure
Current intended branch structure is as such:
- Master (Production
  - Development
    - Feature
    - Feature
  - Fixes

Work will be done locally in branches cut off of the relevant branches here (the relevant feature, or the Fixes branch), and then a pull request will be submitted from the local branch to the remote feature/fix branch.
