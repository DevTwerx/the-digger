# Making your contribution!
Hi! This is a super small project, but I assure you, we appreciate your desire to provide a contribution of any sort, even if it's just a bug report!

### Bug reports
If you have a bug, submit it as a Github issue, with as much information as possible. We do have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/DevTwerx/the-digger/blob/master/documentation/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we would appreciate you abide by.

### Features
If you want to help submit work for an existing work item (we aren't at this point considering random new features from people!) please just submit a pull request against the appropriate feature branch, link the related work item, and provide some description of your code. Someone will be along to review your pull request with all due haste, I'm sure!
